\bigbreak

Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) reduces the vulnerability to side-channel attacks of standard QKD protocols by removing the need for characterized quantum devices.
The higher security guarantees come however, at the price of a challenging implementation.
Here, we tackle the question of the conception of an experiment for implementing DIQKD with photonic devices.
We introduce a technique combining reinforcement learning, optimisation algorithm and a custom efficient simulation of quantum optics experiments to automate the design of photonic setups maximizing a given function of the measurement statistics.
Applying the algorithm to DIQKD, we get unexpected experimental configurations leading to high key rates and to a high resistance to loss and noise.
These configurations might be helpful to facilitate a first implementation of DIQKD with photonic devices and for future developments targeting improved performances.
